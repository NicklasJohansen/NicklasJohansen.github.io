I am a Ph.D. Fellow in Social Data Science at [Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science](https://www.socialdatascience.dk//) at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). He is an elected member of the [SAMF Ph.D. Committee](https://socialsciences.ku.dk/faculty/organisation/councils_and_committees/phd_study_committee/), [SAMF Academic Council](https://socialsciences.ku.dk/faculty/organisation/councils_and_committees/academic_council/), and [UCPH Research & Innovation Council](https://fi.ku.dk/english/kufir/). He has been nominated for [UCPH Study Environment Award](https://aarsfest.ku.dk/english/2022/study-environment-award/) and co-founded SODAS Social Committee.

His research focuses on how digital information has affected behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic using various methods from social sciences and data sciences. Some of his research focuses on misinformation on social media, whereas others investigate learning effects in elementary schools before, during, and after pandemic lockdowns. He is affiliated with three research projects: [HOPE](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/research/projects/hope/), [EduQuant](https://www.economics.ku.dk/research/externally-funded-research_new/uddankvant/), and [Nation-scale Social Networks](https://sodas.ku.dk/projects/nation-scale-social-networks/). He has collaborated with academics and practitioners from the University of Copenhagen, Cornell University, UNICEF New York, The Technical
University of Denmark, Aarhus University, The Danish Health Authorities, Statistics Denmark, and The Danish Ministry of Children & Education.

He teaches three university courses: [Elementary Social Data Science](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ASDK20002U), [Introduction to Social Data Science](https://isdsucph.github.io/isds2021) and [Data Driven Organizational Analysis](https://nicklasjohansen.github.io/DO2021/), and one executive leadership course in [Tech Policy](https://www.socialdatascience.dk/tech-policy).
