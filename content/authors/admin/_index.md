I am a Ph.D. fellow in Social Data Science at the University of Copenhagen. I am lecturing at [Introduction to Social Data Science 2021](https://isdsucph.github.io/isds2021), [Data Driven Organizational Analysis 2021](https://efteruddannelse.kurser.ku.dk/course/2021-2022/ASTK18379U) and [Tech Policy 2021](https://www.socialdatascience.dk/tech-policy)..

My research focuses on social behavior in democratic states during the COVID-19 epidemic, using a wide range of methods from social sciences and data sciences. I have been studying people's mobility patterns, the spread and combatting of misinformation, the deletion and censoring of social media content, and much more. I am part of[The HOPE Project](https://politicalscience.ku.dk/research/projects/hope/) funded by [the Carlsberg Foundation](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en).
