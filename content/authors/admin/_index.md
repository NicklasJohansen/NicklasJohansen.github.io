I am a Ph.D. Fellow in Social Data Science at [Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science](https://www.socialdatascience.dk//) at [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/).

My research focuses on how digital information has affected behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic using a wide range of methods from social sciences and data sciences. Some of my research focuses on misinformation on social media, where others investigate learning effects in elementary school before, during, and after pandemic lockdowns.

I teach three university courses [Elementary Social Data Science](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ASDK20002U), [Introduction to Social Data Science](https://isdsucph.github.io/isds2021) and [Data Driven Organizational Analysis](https://nicklasjohansen.github.io/DO2021/) as well as one executive course for professionals [Tech Policy Lab](https://www.socialdatascience.dk/tech-policy).
